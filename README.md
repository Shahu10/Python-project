2)Detecting Faces in the Images and saving them

3)Training our classifier on the Faces

4)Recognition of expression in new Images

Project Process flow :-

Creating necessary directories --> Extracting Images with expressions --> Creating Data Set of Faces --> Training Images --> Recognition (Testing) --> Display Detected Images.
